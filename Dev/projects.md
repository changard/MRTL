Below are the recommended projects teams can work on throughout the week. Each project is designed to incorporate a new MR Service each day, with all 3 MR services incorporated by the end of the week.

## Art Gallery (Easier)

- **ASA:** User places virtual artwork on the walls. Artwork is visible across application runs.
- **ARR:** User is able to place a complex "sculpture". Sculpture is visible across application runs.
- **AOA:** Sculpture appears sitting on a table or couch, even if the table or couch moves.


## Training and Task Guidance (Medium)

- **ASA:** User places annotations at a physical location. Annotations are visible across application runs.
- **ARR:** User places a complex model and is able to annotate the model. Model and annotations are visible across application runs.
- **AOA:** User places annotations on a physical object. Annotations are visible across application runs, even if the object changes position or rotation.


## Maintenance and Repair (Challenge)

- **ASA:** User adds points along a route. Arrows show how to get from point to point. Points persist across application runs.
- **ARR:** At the last point in the route, a complex model of a piece of equipment appears.
- **AOA:** At the end of the route, a piece of equipment (or furniture) is identified and highlighted.

# Day 1 - Prerequisites and First App

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **Dev and MR Services** Track! Today we'll make sure your PC and HoloLens are fully setup to run labs and participate in team hacks on Days 2, 3 and 4. We'll also build and deploy your first application to HoloLens!

## Prerequisites

Follow along as we walk step-by-step through installing and configuring all <span style="font-size:14.0pt">**[Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)**</span>.

## First App

Now that all tools are installed and configured, we can build our first app. 

1. Start by opening the MS Learning Path [HoloLens 2 Fundamentals: Develop Mixed Reality Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-hololens-2-tutorials/).

1. Complete all steps in the first module: [Introduction to Mixed Reality Toolkit - Create a Mars Curiosity Rover hologram](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/learn-mrtk-tutorials/) ***including* the knowledge check at the end.**

## Success

Congratulations, you just completed Day 1! If you'd like to continue learning, try completing other modules in the [HoloLens 2 Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-hololens-2-tutorials/) path. Just don't complete the [Azure Spatial Anchors]() module since we'll cover that on **Day 2**.

**See you tomorrow!**
